Description: SEraster is a rasterization preprocessing framework that aggregates  
    cellular information into spatial pixels to reduce resource requirements for  
    spatial omics data analysis. SEraster reduces the number of spatial points in  
    spatial omics datasets for downstream analysis through a process of rasterization  
    where single cellsâ€™ gene expression or cell-type labels are aggregated into  
    equally sized pixels based on a user-defined resolution. SEraster is built on  
    an R/Bioconductor S4 class called SpatialExperiment. SEraster can be incorporated  
    with other packages to conduct downstream analyses for spatial omics datasets,  
    such as detecting spatially variable genes.
